This is a grocery-crud library that has been customized to suit my need.

I have send pull requests to merge changes that I made, but some pendings to be merged.
So I maintain this changes to different branch because I prefer use this for my need.

This is my customization:

1. Adding New Feature : columns_align()

   This function use to set columns align on list view, 
   because sometime we need to show currency in right alignment, 
   and another column shown in center alignment.
   You can see documentation and example about this in the commit notes.
